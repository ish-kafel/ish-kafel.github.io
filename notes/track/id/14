  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #c9f297">"THE SOLUTION TO MY CHAOS"</i><p><br>I'm easily overwhelmed when a lot of things need my attention at the same time. I often shut down or become sort of paralyzed when that happens, like I'm running away for the responsibilities and therefore making the hurdles seem even bigger than they already were.<br><br>It comforts me to realize that I am probably not alone in this and that I'm able to recognize this behaviour sooner than I used to. I started noticing that for me this behaviour has a lot to do with the way I see myself and my capabilities. Sometimes even a fear of tasks being too hard, complicated or time consuming, or the fear of potentially getting overwhelmed by stuff, brings me into this self-depreciative thought spiral which tends to push me towards procrastinative and escapist behaviour.<br><br>So to battle this I started to practice detaching emotionally from thoughts about to-dos and planning and just being less hard and perfectionistic on myself in the process. I want to do all these things so why would I allow myself to become discouraged before I even started doing them.<br>Obviously easier said than done, and I have to say that I'm often still bad at it, but this too is a process.<br><br>When I started working on this track I found a melody that I really liked, but I wasn't able to build around it in a fitting way.<br>So after two weeks of looking at that project like it was a lost cause, I opened the project again and just started messing around with what was there, without trying to "make it work". That is when a lot of happy accidents started happening and I was able to finish the song pretty quickly.<br><br>But the realisation that it wasn't as hard and bad as I thought it was in the first place, reminded me of the behavioral pattern I described above.<br>In the end, a lot of the troubles and hurdles we experience are pretty casually solvable.<br><br><i>"<br>Een mens lijdt dikwijls 't meest,<br>Door 't lijden dat hij vreest,<br>Doch dat nooit op komt dagen.<br>Zo heeft hij meer te dragen<br>Dan God te dragen geeft.<br>"</i><br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>Doing something that might be a little out of character or slightly against the rules sometimes can be a very freeing experience.<br>And once you realize that and break out of set parameters and restrictions, you can open yourself up to a whole ocean of new possibilities.<br><br>We put a lot of trash by the bench overseeing the water to show that people had been hanging out there for a while looking out at the water. The ‘No Loitering’ sign also gave the piece a fun touch as well that we felt was very fitting of the title <i>Casual Trouble</i>.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
