  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #c9f297">"THE FEAR OF MYSELF"</i><p><br>I'm sometimes scared to do the things that I really want to do. Especially when those things still feel quite abstract. "I want to make a feature length film" for instance, or "I want to be a master at balancing my daily routines".<br>There are seemingly so many steps and aspects that have to be mastered before I'm able to reach some of my goals, that I used to get scared of disappointing myself at every corner.<br><br>To me this has been an issue for almost as long as I can remember, being a perpetual overthinker and diagnosed with ADD<sub style="opacity: 0.5"> Attention-Deficit Disorder</sub> when I was 5 years old, plus starting medication at the same age, definitely did not help overcome these fears.<br>Don't get me wrong though, medication can be very beneficial for some people, and I have to admit that it was beneficial for me in a lot of ways, but it did introduce me to this idea that took a long time to get rid of: "I can't function on peak efficiency by just being myself without chemical help" which I later discovered, had evolved towards: "I'm not good enough" subconsciously.<br><br>Getting to terms with a cognitive pattern like that is still an ongoing process for me. Often I'm practicing by moving my mind consistently towards appreciation and a sense of self-love, although it's not always easy to convince myself.<br><br>But sometimes, in my experience, it can be easier to overcome psychological hurdles by convincing myself of being some sort of evil, destructive, all-powerful force. Bear with me here, it's not that I'm acting on anything evil related, it's more like I detach myself from my own feelings and thoughts, embracing the idea, or fantasy if you will, that I have some mysterious power.<br>But fantasy or not, it helps me to get shit done pretty often: "Do we stop playing because we grow old, or do we grow old because we stop playing?".<br><br>I'm not sure if it works like this for everyone though, but have you ever listened to that evil-sounding badass banger which puts you into a mindset of "I am the evil ruler of my world and nobody will dare to defy my power"? This might be very personal for me, but tracks like <i>D.A.W</i> by Space Laces, <i>Whatever It Takes</i> by IMANU, <i>Ik Trap</i> by Sevn Alias, <i>Agent Orange</i> by Limewax to name a few, have the tendency to take me there mentally.<br><br>Listening to songs like these really helps me to just do the stuff I don't want to do, like doing dishes. It might come across as a bit weird and you might have used different words to explain the same idea, but this idea of "evil affirmation" (don't know how else to call it hahaha) is the idea behind the track <i>Petrified</i>.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>Looking at yourself and realizing that your insecurities and personal conflicts are what's holding you back can be a very jarring feeling. But on the flip-side, learning to accept that sometimes the problem is not necessarily somebody or something else but yourself can be equally freeing.<br><br>The piece takes a literal approach to ‘looking at yourself in the mirror’ by showing a theater style dressing room with a seemingly endless reflection that gets more and more distorted.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
