  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #c9f297">"THE SEARCH FOR MY PATH"</i><p><br>This song is thematically part of a trilogy of three songs, which all were created together with Iris Penning. <i>Step by Step</i> and <i>Roadside Flowers</i> are the other two songs in this list.<br><i>Step by Step</i> starts this mini story off by explaining my worries surrounding consecutive leaps of faith, and how it can be hard to extrapolate a personal developmental direction when there is so much luck involved in moving forward with the DROELOE project. <i>Written Maze</i> is kind of the same story but it takes place during a later stadium of this.<br><br>The best way to talk about this is to imagine DROELOE as a pebble which we tried to turn into a meteorite. At the start of DROELOE we tried to throw the pebble further and further into space, and every time we did it accumulated more mass so it would get further with every throw. But because of that, it got harder and harder to keep up with the pebble after each time we threw it.<br><br>This is a metaphor for the story of <i>Step by Step</i>, which turns into the story of <i>Written Maze</i> when the pebble leaves Earth's atmosphere.<br>The direction of the pebble is now not just determined by our own throw anymore, but is subject to all kinds of celestial forces, like getting pushed by common opinion and expectation of the project from fans or getting pulled by large gravitational stellar bodies like big artists, large labels or even famous playlists. And apart from that it requires more and more energy to change course as it accumulates more mass while flying through space.<br><br>But don't get me wrong, I'm incredibly grateful for every fan who helped turning this pebble into a meteorite, and I'm proud that it got this big! But how do I see myself as a person in relation to this big flying rock, and how do I remain authority over its trajectory when there are so many forces affecting its direction?<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>Getting lost in all the things that are happening around you and in the process forgetting what's important to yourself and what your story is, is something that's very common these days.<br><br>The endless library portrays an endless amount of ‘things,’ in this case books, to get lost in.<br>With the initial goal being to set out and write your own story, but then losing yourself in the chaos of everything around, we felt like a library with all of its books and ‘stories’ to get lost in was the perfect visual representation of that.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
