  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #f7b598">"A LONG-AWAITED BLOOM"</i><p><br>Most of the first tour we embarked on was finished, there was only one show left which would be at the Exchange in LA. Together with Hein, San and others from our team we were staying in an Airbnb for a couple of days without shows.<br><br>San had made a corner in the living room into a makeshift studio setup, but he was often out and about doing sessions and the rest were doing a lot of meetings, so therefore I was often alone there and I loved it.<br>The environment was beautiful so my love for Echo Park started here - and fun fact: This particular Airbnb later came to be known as the mythical Vestal Ave house where San made his first album.<br><br>I was thinking back a lot about all the memories that were made during this tour, and I couldn't but feel this immense sense of nostalgia and appreciation. It was the first time that I had tasted what a life like this was like and it felt like a new part of me started surfacing.<br>I wanted to try and translate this feeling into music and <i>Lilypads</i> is what came out of it.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>For me the <i>Lilypads</i> artwork is a direct reference to walking around Echo Park during that time.<br>It just felt like we accomplished something next level or something; everything felt very vivid. I think it was because we just almost completed our first US tour and we're just hanging out with the whole team at the time for the first time, getting ready for what almost felt like a victory lap show at Exchange LA back in March of 2017.<br><br>The whole architecture and general feeling of that part of LA was so new to me at the time and so inspiring I think that, together with the memory leading into going in the direction that we did for the artwork.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
