  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #7cb6f4">"WHO AND WHERE AM I"</i><p><br>When I'm really tired and in an area I've never been before, it sometimes feels like the edge of reality is closing in its borders. Almost like things are not rendered in yet, I can't prove my horizon is actually a place I can go to or just the backdrop of the playable area.<br><br>I was staying in a house in LA by myself for a week in between shows when I felt this weird feeling for the first time. I didn't know the area and there was no real incentive to explore further than the corner store one street away, so my "world" stayed small for a week which was a very interesting experience but also a little claustrophobic.<br>This is what inspired <i>LIMBO</i>; built around a small fragment of <i>Taking Flight</i>, I tried to create a similar feeling of limited space.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>I used to have to bike through the forest for a bit, over like a very sparsely lit dirt road. It was the shortest route to go downtown so everytime I wanted to go out with my friends I had to bike through it. As a kid everyone was always saying the forest was filled with murderers and all of those things, so I remember always biking extra fast through it, even though I biked there like a million times.<br><br>I used to always stop halfway where there was little bench and a public water fountain to drink a bunch of water so my mom wouldn't smell that I drank alcohol. Everytime I stopped at that spot I always kind of reflected on what was happening in my life or what happened moments earlier, and I remember often feeling kind of lost in it all.<br><br><i>LIMBO</i> feels like going home through that forest after going out with my friends and stopping at that bench while reflecting on life. Those memories really inspired the way the artwork came out.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
