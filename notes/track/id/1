  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #f7b598">"A MEANINGFUL VACATION"</i><p><br>In my opinion meaningful experiences don't necessarily have to be defined by the consequential value they have in your life.<br>I think even that sometimes the lack of it can be far more eloquent to the perception of beauty and the meaning of life than a lot of life altering experiences can be. I personally believe the same goes for the ways we can experience love.<br><br>This is what the story of <i>Sunburn</i> is to me in a nutshell, told through the metaphor of summer love: meaningless and non-consequential in essence but a beautiful and life enriching experience nevertheless, especially when you and him/her both know from the beginning it will end when it will.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>The feeling of leaving to go somewhere or dropping a loved one off at the train station for them to go somewhere different for a while.<br>That's what inspired me for the artwork. Having the train station be so empty and it being the morning or afternoon kind of enhances that feeling, I think. Makes the whole thing a lot more melancholic to me.<br><br>I used to commute a lot to go to college and later to work. So much that I now have some kind of weird love for train stations in the morning or at night because of that.<br>I really like to work a lot from personal reference, because it somehow feels more connected to me and I have an easier time making decisions because of that. Creating something like an artwork for a song becomes a whole lot easier when you "simply" have to just make whatever you feel like the song reminds you of!<br><br>The <i>Sunburn</i> train station itself is inspired by a mixture of Rotterdam Centraal and Amsterdam Centraal as those were the train stations I would pass through every morning and evening while going to work.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
