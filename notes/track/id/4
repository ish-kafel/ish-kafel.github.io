  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #f7b598">"A DAZZLING EXPERIENCE"</i><p><br>When we just got back home after our first tour, I sat down at my desk when this weird feeling got over me. It felt like nothing had changed but at the same time like everything had changed.<br><br>While reflecting on everything that had happened in the month prior, I felt this overwhelming combination of gratitude; "being able to experience so many awesome things, meeting so many people who enjoy what I make"<br>But also a feeling of confusion and anxiety; "First of all, what the actual f*** actually happened last month?! Second of all, ‘being back home’ seems to not have changed that much but at the same time, both the people I love as well as myself have grown and evolved, and neither of us can really explain themselves to each other it seems. We miss each other still in a way, even now I'm back.<br>‘Is this going to be my life? Phasing in and out of the lives of people I meet and know, with almost no consistent shared experience?’"<br><br>Not long after all these conflicting emotions took a hold of me when I sat down at my desk, they sort of imploded into this feeling I had never experienced before. It was a quiet, a numbness.<br>Peace of mind or shell shock, I still don't know. It transported me into this really intense sense of the present moment, like everything past and future related had faded away.<br>This is the feeling that inspired me to make the track <i>Just Now (2017)</i>.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p><i>Just Now (2017)</i> really reminds me of the feelings I had when I came back home to the Netherlands from touring in America for the first time. It was this really weird feeling of feeling like everything had changed but nothing changed at all.<br><br>I think because our success has always been more so focused in North America compared to back home, that the contrast of those two kind of worlds always felt so interesting. I think <i>Just Now (2017)</i> is a reflection of that.<br>Even though we played really cool shows for a bunch of people on the other side of the world, we eventually had to come home where everything was normal again.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
