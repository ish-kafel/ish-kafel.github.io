  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #7cb6f4">"WHY I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK"</i><p><br>In high school I was the kid that was cool with everyone but I didn't belong consistently to a specific group of friends.<br>I actually went through a lot of phases in terms of identifying myself with subcultures primarily through clothing and music. I've been a metal head wearing a lot of baggy black clothes with Cradle of Filth, System Of A Down and Slipknot shirts and hoodies, but also a hip-hop dude wearing things I thought were hip-hop at the time lol.<br>Then there was also this time that I loved wearing second hand suits, fur coats and other weird s*** I found at the thrift shop. And I ask myself sometimes if the driving factor was to get attention or if it was something else. I think it was a little bit of both.<br><br>I just loved and still love to sometimes wear something weird or stereotypical and listen to specific music fitting the vibe. I love to see what impact it has on my sense of identity through the idea I have of how other people might perceive it. I discovered that I can invoke all these different versions of "myself".<br>So I don't think "fitting in" was a big factor, although sometimes it definitely was of course.<br><br>This trying to reinvent myself comes from a pretty egocentric, almost solipsistic part of me and is often more imaginary than me actually acting differently in situations. So coming to realize that nothing has to be or stay true in how I view myself, the same would go for how I view others.<br>All I see of other people is snapshots of their personality so who am I to draw any conclusions from those. I don't even fully know Who I am myself, so if you think you do, do you.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p><i>Weird Machine</i> really feels like walking through highschool; feeling like the coolest kid in the school while maybe not fitting into the stereotypical cool norm that other people have. It's kind of like embracing your uniqueness and turning that into something cool. Personally I think that's the real cool for lack of a better term.<br>I think embracing who you are, and embracing that you're unique and not trying to fit into any mold or stereotype is something really beautiful.<br><br>The lockers shown in the artwork is what I think when I think highschool. It's a far cry from what the lockers at my own high school looked like, but I feel like highschool as an image is so controlled by how American highschools look like in the movies.<br>The idea was to take that Hollywood stereotype of the lockers being this protected shell of self, all next to each other and bunched into big clusters and turn it upside down with one locker bursting open with personality and being proud of it.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
