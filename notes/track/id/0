  <p>To me <i>Back When (1997)</i> gives off a feeling of wonder and excitement, like that time of excitement you mostly only feel when you're young and everything is new. I feel like that almost childish excitement is something that we lose over the years as we grow older.<br>Maybe it's because of the fact that you're responsible for a lot more things as you keep getting older, or maybe it's because you learn that everything has its ups and downs / positives and negatives, I don't know. But <i>Back When (1997)</i> is definitely an ode to that feeling.<br><br>I vividly remember being a kid and witnessing the fireworks on New Year's Eve for the first time. My mom would send me to bed early in the evening and she would wake me up right before midnight to watch the fireworks.<br>That memory was the driving factor for the artwork as it encapsulated the meaning behind <i>Back When (1997)</i> so well.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
