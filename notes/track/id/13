  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #c9f297">"THE EXCLAMATION OF MY WORRIES"</i><p><br>Some time ago, I had a bunch of friends who were on their phones a lot.<br>When I was hanging out with them, I went on my phone a lot more than usual too, almost because it felt awkward if I didn't. As I'm not really used to that, I noticed myself being way more scatterbrained and passive, plus a lot of conversations stayed on surface level and mostly consisted of sharing videos, memes or articles.<br><br>Pretty fun hang sessions nevertheless, but it wasn't that different from when I was just texting them when they weren't around.<br>Although I love them, I actually felt alone around them. So needless to say, our hang sessions got more sporadic and slowly started to fade away. I started chilling more and more with friends of mine who weren't on their phones at all.<br><br>After a while I felt way more in tune with the present moment, deep relationships formed and we've created all these beautiful memories in the process. And I'm not trying to say; "Yooo my life is awesome because I'm never on a smartphone" Not at all, because that wouldn't even be true lol.<br><br>I guess what I'm trying to say is that being on a smartphone a lot, made me more (socially) anxious and slightly more sad and alone (in the long run), and if you already feel similarly about it I urge you and your friends to start using your phone only for necessities.<br>I wish you all the happiness and togetherness in the world,<br>Let's make some memories.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>The main idea behind the song is about how differences between online and in person communication can lead to a feeling of disconnect. For example, when someone responds to a joke via text the response is often a lot more exaggerated than what it might be in person. This can make conversations like that feel hollow or fake sometimes.<br><br>This idea that we're all connected and together via the internet, yet you can still feel lonely is something that really influenced the artwork. We wanted to display the idea of loneliness and being disconnected with even the people around you with the infinite grid of cubicles.<br>We tried to make each cubicle slightly different to give each of them some personality as well.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
