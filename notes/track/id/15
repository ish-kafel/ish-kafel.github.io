  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #c9f297">"THE BUBBLE OF MY EXISTENCE"</i><p><br>We undoubtedly live in an Information Age.<br>I recently learned that we have created 90% of all the digital data out there in just the last two years alone, and that an average person creates approximately 1.7 MB of data per second. We create an exponentially growing digital landscape which becomes more and more impossible to fully navigate as a normal consumer without the help of large digital platforms.<br><br>A whole bunch of data farming, clickbait and preference predicting algorithms later, we notice the emergence of all these digital echo chambers where people feel recognized and acknowledged by each other because they have similar ideas about the world around them. But because there is no exposure to challenging counterarguments and other worldviews within these "chambers", it also creates blinders and tunnel vision feedback loops in the process.<br><br>I personally think it is interesting to see how a technology built for connectivity can work so counter effectively when it comes to creating a deeper understanding of the people around us. Would that be because of the nuance that gets lost when using social media? Or because being acknowledged by like-minded people provides us with comfort and proof of self-worth, which eventually leads to complacency and diminishes the urge to get to know fellow humans outside of our circle?<br><br>I could add a lot about how all these previously mentioned factors played a role in getting to the weird state and political climate the world is in right now, but I don't really know enough to add to that conversation without becoming too hypothetical.<br>And I'm also not trying to say that social media is inherently bad or that all people are sheep or whatever, there is of course a lot more nuance to this whole subject. And that's exactly why the only thing I personally take away from these thoughts is to try and stay aware of the context of the information I expose myself to, and the reasons why.<br><br>I guess in other words: being open to input and other ideas, listening carefully and growing deliberately, together.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>Sometimes it feels like you can lose your grip on knowing what is going on in the world. There's just too much going on and too many people shouting their own different opinions instead of taking the time to listen.<br>The idea of isolation is a recurring theme in the EP, and with <i>Broken Bricks</i> we wanted to take it one step further and play with the idea of people being isolated by their own thoughts and opinions.<br><br>The lyric about London Bridge falling down was a pivotal piece of the artwork. The piece shows a street in London with the tower bridge crumbling in the background. Yet, nobody seems to notice what is happening outside of their own bubbles.<br><br>I think in our current time it's easy to be stuck inside of your own bubble. With the amount of tainted information that we get thrown at our face from almost all directions, it becomes easy to take that information and base your own reality on that. Especially with algorithms and all of that stuff feeding you more of what you've already had and supposedly enjoyed making it ever so hard to get a new perspective on things and further thickening the walls of your bubble.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
