  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #f7b598">"A LONGING FOR FAMILIARITY"</i><p><br>When you are, for a period of time, constantly exposing yourself to new experiences, unfamiliar situations, and meeting new people, your perception of normality starts shifting.<br>So when coming back to a familiar place after a time like this, it could even happen that it starts to feel strange or that the ways you were able to connect with friends and family before the journey, have changed after you returned.<br><br>I started slowly noticing things like this even during the first tour we did, and not necessarily in either a good or bad way, just different. But because it was different it did affect my personal perception of "Home" and familiarity along the way.<br>And it was, and still is, hard to explain what that felt like but I think the feeling that comes closest to it is "lovingly understanding that you miss something or someone from a different time". This feeling, told through the perspective of "my home" who misses me, is the story behind this song to me.<br><br>But it's definitely not a pessimistic or sad story because I don't think it means that this feeling is irreversible. In the end I personally believe that you can make almost any situation feel like home, as long as you keep routines for yourself which can suggest familiarity and safety of the places you are in (like having one specific candle or a bluetooth speaker you take everywhere if you travel a lot for instance) as well as trying to simultaneously and authentically grow and live with the people you are with. It just takes time for it to feel as home.<br>I'm personally not there yet but continuing to learn in this subject.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>Back to my weird love for Dutch trains, <i>Homebound</i> for me is always connected with the memory of coming home from a party by train.<br>Because the Netherlands is so small and so interconnected by trains, we would always go to shows or parties in different cities. Taking the train in the Netherlands is almost comparable to taking the subway in New York, basically.<br><br>The last train back would always go at around PM _ ish and the following one wouldn't be until AM _ the following day. So it's kind of a sink or swim type situation;<br><i>Homebound</i> reminds me of coming home after a show while being in the AM train. Looking out of the window and watching the world move by. The feeling of loneliness but also finding empowerment in that loneliness that the song has really matches those memories.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
