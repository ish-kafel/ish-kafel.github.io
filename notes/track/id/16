  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #c9f297">"THE POEM TO MY LIFE"</i><p><br>I'm pretty much always tense, nervous but mostly excited seven days before I embark on a tour. The anticipation for this drastic change in environment, context and ultimately reality is something that I look forward to every time.<br>Getting in time for the plane and making sure everything works out logistically is where the nervousness comes from mostly, because as soon as I'm on that plane, I can't wait to submerge myself in the adventures to come.<br><br>I can't remember when this was exactly but at the start of one of the tours we did, I arrived a couple of days early in Los Angeles. I was staying by myself somewhere pretty close to downtown, and I wanted to explore the streets, so I rented a scooter and cruised through downtown during sunset.<br>It's kinda hard to describe what that felt like but I guess it came close to feeling like I was the observer of a strange foreign world, without being affected by it, like I was traveling through a dream.<br>All the excitement from the week leading up to this moment faded away in an instant and in my mind things turned silent for a change.<br><br>When I got back to the house I was staying at, I felt really inspired and started improvising on the piano. I recorded a lot of separate melodies on top of each other and <i>Komorebi</i> is what came out of it.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p><i>Komorebi</i> is the Japanese term for "The interplay between light and leaves when sunlight shines through trees" and carries some nostalgic and melancholic values.<br>Something more closer and more relatable to myself would be the smell of rain on the warm concrete in the summer. There is something about that smell that brings me back for some reason.<br>It reminds me of playing in the park close to my mom's house in the summer and how simple life was back then. The only thing I had to worry about was to come back home when the streetlights turned on, otherwise my mom would be mad at me.<br><br>The simplicity of watching something like the light filter through the leaves or the smell of rain or warm concrete having so many emotions and memories linked to it, to me, is something really special and something that I think is beautiful.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
