  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #7cb6f4">"WHERE DO I START"</i><p><br>It's a weird feeling to sit on a plane that is taking off, knowing that there are a lot of new and crazy experiences lying ahead when you land.<br>The flight itself is like a purgatory of anticipation - especially when we noticed that the music was well received by more and more people.<br><br>Around that time I sometimes had a similar feeling when I wasn't sitting on a plane, but just going through comments on social media. It still feels unreal reading all these positive reactions, and thinking about the people who wrote them blows my mind with awe, gratitude and Sonder.<br>It was an adrenaline rush to realize that all these things that felt like a dream were actually real. That rush is what inspired this track.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>The feeling of going somewhere new or going outside of your comfort zone is something that comes to mind when I think of <i>Taking Flight</i>.<br>It's kind of comparable to getting on a plane to some place new, whether it's to go on a vacation or for other reasons you know that there is a lot that's going to happen and that you'll be away from home for a while. Whether you see home as a place or as your comfort zone.<br>That feeling is something I've dealt with a lot over the years, especially when we started touring. It's kind of an anxious feeling mixed with excitement.<br><br>I personally think of myself as someone who performs pretty bad under stress or while being anxious about something, but I kind of always deal with it by convincing myself that there is no such thing as stress or anxiety. Which in turn I think has sometimes numbed me of the good parts of those feelings when they are more so feelings of excitement and not so much stress or anxiety.<br>So for me this track is an ode to the positive side of those feelings and a reminder to embrace them more.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
