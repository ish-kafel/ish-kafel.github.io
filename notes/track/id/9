  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #7cb6f4">"WHERE AM I HEADING"</i><p><br>I personally believe that for me to achieve something big, I need to make consistent, well thought out leaps of faith. Jumping into the unknown, like going on tour, playing places I've never been, partnering up with management companies I've never worked with, or just jumping on opportunities in general.<br>Even if you do extensive research, you never fully know what you're getting into and what it'll be like. And although most of the time this is something beautiful imo, I've noticed it can become a problem when you feel like you're "airborne" more often than grounded.<br><br>When this happened to me, I asked myself often: Is there a point of no return? Did I already cross it? Why do I care if there even is such a thing as a point of no return? Why does constantly progressing at a fast pace seem to scare me? Is it stemming from a basic need for mental stability, being comfortable, relatable, or is it a conservative resistance or fear for the unknown?<br><br>Either way, these thoughts are not going to stop me from trying to achieve big goals this way, but I did learn to be more mindful of the implications of consistently exposing myself to new, it's good to stay in touch with the old too.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p><i>Step by Step</i> for me feels like standing in line to go to the bathroom at a club. You're totally f***ed up and you really need to pie.<br>After you're done pieing you go and wash your hands and look at yourself in the mirror and realize "What the f*** am I doing with my life, why am I here, I don't even like this music, I hate hangovers. How did it get to this?!"<br><br>I personally used to not really be that much of a partier when I was younger, but I always caught myself going out more and drinking more whenever I was kind of dealing with stuff or I wanted to run away from something.<br>That idea of running away from your problems or kind of wandering off your path because you hit a roadblock is what comes to mind for me with <i>Step by Step</i>.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
