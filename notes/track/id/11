  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #7cb6f4">"WHAT I AM MADE OF"</i><p><br>I am proud. Proud of where I come from, where I'm at now and how I got here - but sometimes it's really easy for me to lose sight of that pride.<br>That's why my friends, family and me remind each other of the pride we owe to ourselves sometimes, because I think that everyone has a lot to appreciate and be proud of. In my experience, exercising that creates leniency and energy to move forward.<br><br>Bad times are trophies, good times are time capsules - Let's honor them appropriately, so we can make more of them. Reason enough to keep making ourselves aware of this at times, I would think.<br>This is what <i>Looking Back</i> is about from my perspective.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>Being nostalgic and kind of melancholic while looking at something from your past and remembering all the good but also all the bad things that happened. That's what I feel <i>Looking Back</i> is about.<br><br>I think having the artwork be a darkroom is a perfect metaphor for this feeling. You're looking back at what has happened and you can choose to develop certain pictures or not.<br>I believe that it's good to take the good with the bad sometimes and embrace everything that you've done. All the good things, the victories, the good times but also all the mistakes and ugly moments. For me looking back at what has happened is the only way to really be grateful for where you are now or what you've become.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
