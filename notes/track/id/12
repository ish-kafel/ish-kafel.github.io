  <p><i>OATH</i> describes the feeling of finding a book that's completely covered in dust and when you start reading it, it totally changes the way you think about things and leads you on a whole different journey in life.<br>I think that feeling of getting a glimpse of what your purpose or destination in life is or what it could be is what speaks to me the most when I hear <i>OATH</i>.<br><br>The idea of the little girl starting her journey in this otherworldly landscape that seems to be forever rising, I think is a really direct metaphor for this feeling; and it really connects with what I feel the song is about.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
