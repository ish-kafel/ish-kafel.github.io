  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #7cb6f4">"WHAT I WANT TO BE WHEN I GROW UP"</i><p><br>When I was young I always wanted to be able to use magic, and not rabbit out of a hat kinda magic but real magic: Shaping reality around me to a more wondrous, efficient and fun version of it.<br>Needless to say, Harry Potter was my idol during this time. I wanted to be just like him.<br><br>Thinking back I noticed that I often miss this kid with the outrageous dreams, beliefs and wishes.<br>I miss that magical perception of reality, but at the same time, I have myself to blame for not allowing myself to dwell, daydream or fantasize too much on a "fictional reality" like that. Mainly because I feel a need to hold on to actual reality, which would be a version of reality that everyone agrees with to be "true", I guess. But who defines this "actual reality"?<br>Aren't we already cherry-picking on what to believe and knowingly, as well as unknowingly, attributing all kinds of fiction and non-fiction to our personal sense of "real life"?<br><br>Do we choose the types of realities that are most relatable to our environment because we want to be recognized and acknowledged by it ourselves, or do we, in the search of acknowledgement and belonging, technically get a reality assigned to us in the process unknowingly?<br>This track is about getting back in touch with that kid I once was, and trying to learn from him; "Do we stop playing because we grow old, or do we grow old because we stop playing?"<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>For me this kind of feels like a continuation of <i>Back When (1997)</i>;<br>it doesn't feel like the same excitement though, it feels like more of a "I know what I want and I'm excited to try and get there" feeling of excitement. The artwork kind of symbolizes that with the superhero cartoon show on TV and the action figure laying on the ground.<br><br>I've throughout my life always considered myself lucky for having that feeling very early on in my life and knowing almost exactly what I wanted to do. I knew from a young age that I wanted to do something creative and visually based when I grew up, and I think that's really helped my progress in life.<br>I've seen a lot of close friends really struggle with finding their passion in life and figuring out stuff like what to major in college, and those kind of things that I've always been grateful for finding my passion at an early age.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
