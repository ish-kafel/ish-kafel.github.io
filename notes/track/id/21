  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #c9f297">"THE REASON I WON'T STOP"</i><p><br>Sometimes I'm working on a track and everything feels like it's working against me; this happens primarily in the finalizing stage when the project becomes really CPU-heavy and the decision making happens mostly on a microscopic scale. It takes a lot of effort to get through this phase but when I do, the reward is more than worth it.<br><br>When it comes to it, I definitely love it more to create something that I love myself, than to show something I created to the world.<br>Of course it's a great feeling to get positive feedback on something I've created and that definitely is helping me to get through tough moments, but just that wouldn't be enough for me to continue this path. I thoroughly enjoy creating something that exceeds my own expectations, even if it means I have to drag myself through hell and back to reach that point.<br><br>At times, for instance - when finishing all of the EP's, it even became kind of a masochistic process where I obsessively invest all my time in finishing the music, paying little to no regard to sleep and nourishment. And although it is definitely also nice to stay healthy and sane, I have to admit that I live for these times of pushing myself to the limit.<br>That is to me what this song is about; seeing that I made it during one of these obsessive sprints for the finish line.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>Problems and hardships can often be difficult, sad, or stressful to deal with. But sometimes you just need to go ‘F*** it’ and just push through it either to fix it yourself or to let it heal with time.<br>Who cares if during that time, you don't seem super happy or funny or pretty or whatever way you'd prefer to see yourself in? As long as you're actively trying to push through a difficult situation, better times will come.<br><br>This is reflected in the artwork which shows a courtyard in-between buildings with an almost impossible-to-climb staircase that eventually leads to the light at the end of the metaphorical tunnel for those that ‘Push Through.’<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
