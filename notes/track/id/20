  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #c9f297">"THE JOY OF PUSHING MY LIMITS"</i><p><br>Have you ever had those days where everything just works?<br>Those days where getting stuff done only inspires to do more, like an insatiable hunger for productivity, getting dopamine hits with every checkmark on your to-do list.<br><br>I personally don't have those types of days often, and thinking about it, I'm kinda happy I don't because such an obsessive flow-state probably isn't good in the long run regarding balance and sustainability. Although I'm still not sure to what extent that might be an obstructing cognitive hurdle of mine.<br>Either way, the joy of working hard on those days is definitely an inspiration for days where things aren't going as smoothly.<br><br>So sometimes I try to conjure up this part of me that just gets stuff done without thinking too much about it. That's why I wanted to make a song which could help me get into that mindset, and <i>Grind & Hustle</i> is what came out of it.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p><i>Grind & Hustle</i> to me feels like the perfect song to play when you're working on something and everything feels like it's flowing.<br>The feeling of having fun with what you're working so hard on really sticks to in this case.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
