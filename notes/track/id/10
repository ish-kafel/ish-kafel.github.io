  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #7cb6f4">"WHY I'M STILL GOING"</i><p><br>It's almost corny to say that life has ups and downs, but that doesn't make it less true. "This too shall pass" is another corny thing to say about this subject - but also very true.<br>Taking it even a step further, I'd like to think that often the good times cannot exist without the bad times; how would you know the difference? How could you fully appreciate a time as being good or better if you haven't experienced worse?<br><br>I really love this idea because it gives me the opportunity to appreciate the cycle more than just the good times while hating the bad times, and has therefore helped me create a more mild outlook on myself and life in general. When I approach my experience of time like a cycle, a lot of other new opportunities become visible as well.<br>What stays constant for me is a passion for making music, telling stories, tinkering on big questions and experiencing stuff together with others. And for me, because I know these things about myself, the rest becomes more fluid and ground for experimentation.<br><br>I've tried reinventing parts of myself, changing my surroundings, feeling out nuances, references and ultimately cognitions in my perception of bad times.<br>"Are they even that bad and do they have to be?" I really love to think this way because I feel like I've grown a lot doing so; this song to me is a reminder of this specific mindset.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p><i>Turn Around</i> is an ode to balance, specifically balance in terms of good and bad experiences or decisions.<br>With the artwork being almost a day time version of <i>LIMBO</i> where you can see what's around you and where you're going, it for me kind of resembles just that. How a perceived "good" situation and a perceived "bad" situation can kind of live in harmony with each other and almost need each other to exist.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
