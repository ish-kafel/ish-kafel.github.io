  <i style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh; color: #c9f297">"THE ANGER TOWARDS THE WORLD WHICH I'M A PART OF"</i><p><br>It was really strange to notice at some point that some people around me acted in a way that didn't feel authentic anymore. I realised that some were being nice because they wanted something else from me and Hein, which regrettably led to some really awkward moments here and there.<br>But at the same time it would be hypocritical of me to say that I'm fully "innocent" in this as well. I would be lying if I said that I didn't want to show the "best version" of myself when I meet someone I look up to, in the hope that something beautiful would come out of it.<br><br>But what does this ‘best version of myself’ look like in a social dynamic setting, and is it still me?<br>I believe that this ‘best version of myself’ is again closely linked to the way I look at myself in general. I.e. if I don't like myself very much, portraying that better version would feel more out of reach than if I did. So chances are it could come across as less authentic.<br><br>But apart from all this I think that with every type of social interaction some sort of exchange happens. Whether it's exchanging information, exchanging love or acknowledgement or expecting an apology. In almost all situations our social actions seem to be driven by some sort of personal need.<br>Even if we truly act selflessly, we feel content with our actions and more dignified in how we explain ourselves, and maybe even fulfilled as a result. Selflessness could therefore still be rewarded with a pretty egocentric mental currency, fulfilling a personal need.<br>And there's nothing wrong with that in my opinion.<br><br>With all this in mind, I think that trying to amplify a positive self-image and staying aware of the inherently less charming more selfish parts of my brain are diminishing the chances that I would impulsively act manipulatively or unauthentically.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>
