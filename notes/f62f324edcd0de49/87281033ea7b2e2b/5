  <p style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh"><i>"LET'S KEEP TRYING TO CONNECT IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD"</i><sup style="opacity: 0.5"><br>- APIM</sup></p><p><br>It's interesting how the comfort of getting my phone out when situations are slightly awkward, has an impact on me in so many subtle ways.<br>Because in the end, by making a habit out of this, I condition myself to flee from discomfort, which down the line could, and probably will, crossover to other aspects of my life. Because like with every form of mental addiction, at some point, the habit becomes the solution for all the holes in my comfort zone, mainly because of the fact that the habit seems easier than the alternative, seeing that the ability to cope with discomfort declines over time if you don't actively expose yourself to it.<br><br>I feel the need to get to know new people and make new friends lately. It's not that I'm alone, and I also still love my friends, but how do I meet people randomly without being awkward or weird?<br>It happens so often that I see someone on the street or on a train and think "I get the feeling that you are super cool and that we could be friends, I like your style and you seem to listen to music I like as well. I want to get to know you, but getting your attention and trying to spark a conversation feels like I'm disturbing you because you are busy on your phone. There seem to be too many obstacles that could potentially make this situation awkward as hell, so to protect my sense of confidence, why don't I do the same to rid myself of this feeling?"<br>And that's when I usually grab my phone.<br><br>But I don't want that, I remember the moments well when I had a short non-consequential conversation with a stranger, and those were weirdly enough often the highlights of the day. To me personally it even boosts my confidence to have a random chat with someone.<br><br>So why don't I do it more often? Because when it comes to it, the same rules apply for the ability to cope with discomfort when in reverse; the more I expose myself to it, the easier coping with it will become. That's what this track is about, we still can expand our comfort zone, let's celebrate that power!!<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p><i>Virtual Friends (Reimagined)</i> to me symbolizes the need for human interaction and celebrates that.<br>The original was almost a cry for help about this feeling of being digitally connected with everything and everybody 24/7, but not feeling that connection as much as you would in person. The reimagined version on the other hand, I think, gives you that feeling of in-person connection and celebrates that need for that.<br><br>The artwork being almost like a "Post-office party" gone crazy, I think reflects that feeling and offers a nice contrast between the lonely and desolate cubicles of the original.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
