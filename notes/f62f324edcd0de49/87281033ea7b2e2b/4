So when I'm done with this text, I still need to encrypt everything for the treasure skull thread but after that, in terms of work from my end, this chapter is fully done and completed.<br><br>I'm currently sitting in the garden of the house I just moved into a month ago. It's the 15th of December so 2020 is almost coming to an end. And holy s***, obviously a lot has happened for all of us this year.<br>Crazy to see how a couple of numbers in the context of time measurement got so synonymously linked with "a Bad time", that it almost became a symbol for it. Needless to say everyone has battled through a lot this year, and I hope that while you are reading this, you realize that that is something you can be very proud of. I know I am, even though that doesn't make any of it easier.<br><br>But with the year coming to an end and this chapter of DROELOE as well, I feel like this is a good time to take a step back and enjoy observing life without fully participating, even if it's just for a week or two, I just need the dust to settle.<br>I'm planning on meditating a lot, going on a lot of walks in nature, finally reading some of the books on my shelf and just being around and with the people I love. I need to recharge, and even though I know that in order to do that effectively, I need to rid myself of some habits that are counterproductive for that matter; like getting lost on YouTube or social media, having unhealthy eating and sleeping patterns, and the feeling of lacking control and oversight when it comes to knowing my boundaries.<br><br>But I know I will get there! Just for the fact that I'm aware of what would do me good and what won't, and that awareness and knowledge is the first step in the right direction.<br>If you also feel like you need a break from it all, try to allow it to yourself - because if you have the opportunity to do so, I can guarantee you that everything will feel less tiresome than it does now, I speak from experience and can't wait to reach that point again myself. Knowing what you need in order to move forward and acting on it, is one of the definitions of "self-love" in my opinion.<br><br>I know you are able to reach that, or maybe you already feel like you have; either way I know you can because everyone has the power to get to know themselves better; it just takes effort, time and perspective. But I can't other than conclude that I believe in you, because we're not that different after all.<br><br><img src="image/text.png" width="125%"><br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>"Stop and smell the flowers" is a saying that I think reminds me the most of this track. I feel like <i>Roadside Flowers</i> embodies the feeling of being on a long, often hard journey through life and hopefully reminds you that along that journey, you have to sometimes stand still for a while to take everything in and reflect on what has happened and kind of get lost in it all for a moment.<br><br>I personally often struggle to kind of take these standstill moments and look at things from a macro perspective. And I only usually only find time in my head to do that after everything has been said and done.<br>But I think doing this throughout the "journey" could give interesting insight into things and would maybe even allow you to correct your course in the process.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
