Who would have thought back in the basement of the HKU <sub style="opacity: 0.5"> Utrecht School of the Arts</sub> that we would make it this far, and eventually end up here?<br>From drinking old cold coffee while working all night in that shitty house in Utrecht, to playing for thousands of people on the other side of the world - I can't say how grateful I am for the moments that we've shared together. We've both been through so much these last 5 years and have grown so much in the process.<br>There have definitely been some ups and downs throughout but these moments that we've shared together is something that nobody can ever take away from us.<br><br>Altho it might seem sad that our journey together is coming to an end, I'm happy for the way it ended.<br>I'm happy that we've put this amazing album together that really symbolizes these last 5 years together. And altho this was the last thing we did together it's going to be there forever.<br><br>I wish you all the best for the future, and even though this is the end of something, it's also the beginning of something else; something for which I wish you all the best and I can't wait to see what it turns into!<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
