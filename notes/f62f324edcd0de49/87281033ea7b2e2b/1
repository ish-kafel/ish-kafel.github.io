  <p style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh"><i>"LET'S TAKE IT AS IT COMES,<br>BUT MAINLY JUST ENJOY WHAT IT CAN BE"</i><sup style="opacity: 0.5"><br>- AMIT</sup></p><p><br>While the original explores the potential value of a non-consequential isolated event by romanticizing the fleeting aspect of that moment, this version is an attempt to take that story one step further by romanticizing the combination of impulsiveness, a little bit of indifference but a large amount of "going with the flow".<br>Although I haven't personally experienced this often, during the moments I did, I felt alive and full of momentum. Maybe to me this type of "mindset" is more rewarding because it's in many ways the opposite of my normal state of mind; thinking a lot, perfectionistic, and an overall delay between my actions and my thoughts due to often being overly deliberate.<br><br>I'm still grateful for these personality traits however, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to pull all of this off. But it does give a good reason for my romantic perception of "going with the flow", seeing it doesn't come naturally to me.<br><br>With this reimagination I tried to approach the feeling I get when I do reach a flow-state, and I'm glad I've been able to conjure that mindstate by listening to it again after a while. And even though it only happened two or three times until now, to me, it was more than worth it to make something that potentially has this effect on me.<br>Practice makes perfect.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p><i>Sunburn</i> was obviously our biggest song to date so reimagining it had quite a bit of pressure behind it. To me personally the original version reminded me of saying goodbye to someone you held dear in your life, and having these mixed feelings of sadness while also being happy and in wonder of the moments you shared with them.<br>The reimagined version on the other hand feels more like being happy with the people you already have around you and taking things as they come, effectively enjoying the moment that you're in currently.<br><br>These two feelings can kind of feel like day and night to each other. The contrast between those moments and the fact that train stations, at least in the Netherlands have such a different vibe during that morning/afternoon then during the night - is what inspired the artwork of <i>Sunburn (Reimagined)</i>.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
