I matched their BPM first, then pitched it to the same key, and from there on out, I started muting certain stems to create room to make something new on top of that. After a while of working on the new elements, I muted all the stems of the intros to hear if the new material would hold up on its own.<br>It obviously didn't at first, so I started to work on it without all the layers on top. After some polishing, it sounded great on its own, but when I unmuted all the other layers, it felt too cluttered.<br><br>I took out some more elements from the layers to create more breathing room in the complete context, and after that the song was done. I bounced and mastered the <i>Panorama</i> version without layers, did the same with the layers separately, checked if it still held up if I just dropped it underneath each other without any processing;<br>it did, and I was really proud it all worked out!!<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>Through this process of making this "4th" perspective on our work, one of the most interesting things was to see all the work we did prior from a birds-eye view, a "Panorama" of all our work if you will. Being able to really take a step back from what we created back then was a really insightful experience and something that's sometimes so hard to replicate when you're in the thick of it all.<br><br>Looking back at all the work we did I couldn't help but have an overwhelming sense of gratefulness. We had all these little stories and objects that held so much significance and previously unseemingly fitted so nice together.<br>The idea to have the artwork, and later on the whole visual concept of the album be centered around this museum of DROELOE so to speak was mainly derived from this feeling and seemed like a perfect fit for what the song represented and technically the album as a whole stood for.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
