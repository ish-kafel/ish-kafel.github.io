  <p style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh"><i>"LET'S REMEMBER WE HAVE BLIND SPOTS,<br>WHICH WE CAN ONLY FIND BY LOOKING AT THEM"</i><sup style="opacity: 0.5"><br>- TCWF</sup></p><p><br>A while back, around May in 2020 I was feeling so restless and not focused due to being cooped up because of COVID, that I decided to book an Airbnb for a week in Eindhoven, the place where I spent all of my high school years and still have a lot of friends.<br>It came in handy because I was already looking for a house to rent over there while I was finishing the music for AMOP, so it was a "two birds with one stone" type situation.<br><br>But when I was there, I noticed something pretty strange.<br>All of a sudden, I saw the city I knew so well in a totally different light. It was like the minor shift in context had changed my whole outlook on the city while I was walking in between familiar buildings. The best way to explain why this felt so weird is that for the first time the two worlds of "touring life" and "normal" life collided, seeing that I've never spent time in an Airbnb outside of tour. Similar to how spending a night in a hotel within your own city can make you feel like a strange type of tourist, I presume.<br><br>Either way, I was fascinated by this and wondered if this could also apply to other aspects of my life. How do I slightly change the context of something to "refresh" my perception thereof?<br>Take how I look at my own past for instance, my memories consist of auditory and visual representations of experiences from the past, which I glue together with inner dialogue to help it make sense, fill in the gaps and explain where I come from to myself.<br>But I have definitely noticed moments where my explanation of something in the past was way different from how other people experienced that same moment, to a point where I've caught myself assuming something from far back in the past that didn't even happen that way, it was all in my head.<br><br>So I know now that I need to stay aware of that inner dialogue to prevent it from distorting my outlook on things. But could it also work the other way around?<br>Could I, by changing the language of my inner dialogue, lower the amount of stress I get when I try to get through something out of my comfort zone for instance? Could I have gravely underestimated the power of the language that I use unknowingly? And to take it even a step further into imaginative and scientifically poorly substantiated speculation; "do we define and translate our life through language or do we use language to dictate and subsequently create the lives we live?".<br><br>Even though this is pretty far fetched, I personally still see value in the question, because to me, this question helps me to stay aware of my inner dialogue and the significance thereof.<br><br><i>"<br>Question everything.<br><br>Live for Idiosyncrasy while gamifying your life,<br>but remember that you are never alone.<br>Belief, knowledge and language are underestimated tools,<br>master the nuances and common denominators.<br><br>Learn because you want to. Grow because you need to.<br><br>Nihilism doesn't have to be pessimistic.<br>Nothing is true, everything is permissible.<br>Shape it to your will, without drastically hurting yourself or others.<br><br>Sonder.<br>Self Awareness.<br>Rinse and Repeat.<br>"</i><br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>The original version of <i>Looking Back</i> to me was an ode to all the good and bad memories that you accumulate throughout your life. The reimagined version on the other hand I think looks at these moments and evaluates them.<br><br>I personally think that we build our own reality out of the memories that we select for this reality. This obviously sparks the question of what memories do we select and are we forgetting some of them? Are we building our own reality based upon facts or on our interpretation of things?<br>I think all of those questions are definitely valid once.<br><br>The artwork of <i>Looking Back (Reimagined)</i> was inspired by this idea too. Sometimes I think it's a good idea to literally turn things upside down to test them or to evaluate their truth, and that is almost exactly what we did for the artwork.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
