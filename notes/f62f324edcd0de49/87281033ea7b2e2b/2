  <p style="font-family: b; font-size: 2.2vh"><i>"LET'S FIND THE REASONS FOR WAKING UP"</i><sup style="opacity: 0.5"><br>- TCWF</sup></p><p><br>I am still struggling with following and making my own routines to stay "productive". And there definitely was a time when I hated myself for not being able to reach a certain level of productivity.<br>I still catch myself doing that sometimes, but I guess that in small amounts it could even be healthy in a way. Because if I was constantly content with my achievements, complacency would lurk around the corner, wouldn't it? Either way, shortly after we released <i>I Can't Wait</i> I started working on the songs for the anthology album.<br>The plan to create an intro, 3 continuations of the EP's and two new reimaginations felt like an enormous task ahead of me.<br><br>So as if I conditioned myself ;) I started procrastinating more, because honestly, the amount of work scared me a little even though it was definitely an irrational and easily debunkable fear: <i>"Een olifant eet je ook in kleine hapjes"</i> - which is a slightly gruesome Dutch saying but the metaphor is very true in this context; just start with one small thing, when finished start something else, and all the things will get done eventually.<br><br>Anyhow, I remembered I wrote part of the lyrics for this track while I was on the road just before the lockdown, and when trying to come up with the track ideas for the anthology this one just clicked instantly to build into the continuation of <i>The Choices We Face</i>.<br>So I worked on <i>Open Blinds</i> first, finished it, and took the affirmation it turned out to be for me into the production process of the other tracks that were still ahead.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ V</h2>

  <p>Life can be hard sometimes, there are expectations from everybody and everything, including yourself sometimes. And to manage these expectations can be a real struggle, especially when you get older and all of these expectations and responsibilities seem to increase by the day.<br>In order to manage all these expectations and to fulfill all of those responsibilities is almost an impossible task especially if you don't want to lose yourself in the process. To me personally these things always come down to choices. The downside to that is that more often than not making those choices always come with some sort of remorse.<br><br>Whenever I make one of these choices in the favor of my own self-comfort or I push things back because I feel like I need a break, there is always this voice in the back of my mind telling me that I could have spent my time better and that I need to effectively "get back to work".<br>That voice in the back of my mind can be such a heavy burden on me that I'll go over my own boundaries and get back to work, which in turn leads to this never ending cycle of taking a break but going back to work because you feel like you are not spending your time right, and you're not upholding all of the expectations/responsibilities that you have, and then feeling burned out - and repeating the whole thing over again.<br><br>So I think maybe it's sometimes better to just be aware of all those things. Your own self, the expectations and responsibilities and all the things you need to do. And to just try your best to fulfill all of these things but to be aware of that you're only human and sometimes you can't do it all.<br><br><br></p><h2>_ H</h2>
