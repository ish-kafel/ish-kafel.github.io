    <p><br><br>I made most of the songs on this EP around the time that we were going on tour for the first time.<br>Some were started before but definitely made in the excitement of anticipation. I wanted to fully breathe in all the experiences lying ahead while reflecting on the weird and bumpy path that was behind me.<br><br>So to me retrospectively this chapter is about acknowledging the importance of growing my awareness of personal moments in life, good and bad, to learn to appreciate them while living through them and subsequently the significance they can have as a point in time.<br>I learned that identifying those points gives the ability to draw lines between them, connecting them, mapping them out, to learn from the lessons they can hold for the future.<br><br>But now I'm getting ahead of myself.<br><br><br></p>

    <p>The bulk of the <i>A Moment In Time</i> EP got constructed and conceptualized during and right after our first tour in North America. That first tour was such a massive and moving experience, that even to this day I think about those 4 months of constantly stepping out of my comfort zone a lot.<br>When we came back from the tour and sat down to figure out the overarching concept of the EP, it was kind of a no-brainer to have all of it be inspired by those moments and memories, and to dive further back into memories that had from the past.<br><br>I'd like to think of <i>A Moment In Time</i> as this time capsule of that period of my life, when everything was new and exciting and inspiration was bursting out of everything.<br>I catch myself often looking back at it, when I need to remind myself that for me personally in order to keep creating;<br>I need to live, I need to experience new things, make new memories and find new moments to look back upon.<br><br><br></p>
