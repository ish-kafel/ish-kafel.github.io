    <p><br><br>My mom used to tell me from time to time everything you pay attention to grows. But it wasn't until later, around the time that I started working on the music for this EP, that I realized the far-reaching extent of this statement and I started taking it more to heart.<br><br>I've always been an overthinker, which helps me heap in a creative sense but I noticed more and more that it was also a disadvantage in a lot of ways - especially when self-image and what-ifs become part of the equation.<br>It's really easy for me to think myself into a corner about things that affect my levels of insecurity and sense of self-worth, which consequently was a big part of the root for my problems with procrastination, fleeing and self-destructive behaviour. The more that became apparent to me, the more I realized I wanted to move away from those aspects of overthinking.<br><br>Although that is of course easier said than done, I noticed the phrase "everything you pay attention to grows" played an increasingly important role in the path away from that mentality and mindstate. In fact it caused a spur in shifting my perspective towards the path away from that mentality and changing it into the path towards a new mentality. Because in the end, the only difference between overthinking and thinking ahead is a sense of direction and vision in my opinion.<br><br>The TCWF hard ticket tour went hand in hand with developing this shift in mentality, as it was one of the most empowering experiences I've had since the first tour when we were opening for San Holo; it is kind of hard to explain how it was different, but it was definitely an extremely rewarding time in my life which was offering a lot of perspective and ideas for things in the future. I made a lot of the music for <i>A Promise Is Made</i> during this tour and in the months after it.<br><br>The concepts behind the songs on APIM are an exploration of the sense of direction, goals and promises I wanted to develop within myself, on a personal level as well as, and intertwined with, exploring ideas I have about the world around me.<br><br><br></p>

    <p>For me <i>A Promise Is Made</i> feels like the final chapter of a story. But also as a full story in itself.<br>I
      feel like this EP is one of the most complete EP's we've made in terms of how the story flows throughout all the
      tracks and makes a complete circle in the end. In terms of the process of making <i>A Promise Is Made</i> I think
      I very much felt like this final chapter deserved some form or mystery and grandness to it that the two other EP's
      didn't get. I personally felt like the artworks for the EP had to show some kind of mastery of the medium of some
      sorts.<br><br>We played around with different perspectives throughout the other two EP's, and I felt like this one
      should kind of take that past experience and knowledge and really take the idea of perspectives and turn it upside
      down and twist it around, effectively trying to show mastery of the medium and show this natural progression
      between the EP's.<br><br>Coming up with all the ideas to bend the perspectives and to play around with them was a
      lot of fun but also quite challenging at times. I build everything in 3D for the artworks, and even though it's
      all digital and in theory everything should be possible, it's sometimes really tricky to balance that fine line
      between keeping the feeling or realism but breaking all the physical rules that come with it.<br>Also the scale of
      some of these artworks was something that I've never done before and therefore created quite a challenge at
      times.<br><br>That being said, I'm really happy with how the artworks came out in the end and I think the whole
      project in general is something I'm very proud of.<br><br><br></p>
