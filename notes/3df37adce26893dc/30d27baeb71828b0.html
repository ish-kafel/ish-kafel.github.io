    <p><br><br>Along the way a lot has changed and a lot of moments passed; things that felt unusual and exciting before
      seemed to have lost their novelty a little bit, and other things became more apparent, like "Holy s*** - we're
      running a company, how do we do that? Do I try to do something with all these opportunities that are coming my way
      or do I focus on making music like I have till now?<br>Do we want to tour more or less? How much time would we
      have left to create stuff? Do we play other people's music or try building a show around our own?"<br>It was a lot
      to get used to.<br><br>I was often overstimulated and therefore there were a lot of moments where I felt lost, out
      of touch and lacking control over myself and my surroundings.<br>But at the same time I fully realized that this
      was the life I still wanted to live and that all the great and inspiring moments like interacting with people
      fans, crowds or just random encounters in real life, but also appreciative moments when I was on the road working
      on music I felt connected to, definitely weighed up to the lesser moments.<br><br>Therefore in a lot of ways this
      EP is about that question of "How do I live with the life I want to live, and which choices are the right ones to
      do so?"<br>I felt like I needed to grow in a lot of ways, and realizing that was the first step, but I'm getting
      ahead of myself again.<br><br><br></p>

      <p><i>The Choices We Face</i> kind of came at a time where I kind of felt lost. It wasn't necessarily lost due to
        a lack of direction, but I guess more so lost due to the abundance of possibilities.<br><br>With <i>The Choices
          We Face</i> being the second EP that we were gonna put out it felt like we had to make some sort of a
        statement. We weren't the new kids on the block anymore, this wasn't our first rodeo. And I think that, at the
        time, that feeling was kind of haunting us.<br>Together with it being the second bigger project that we were
        coming out with, it also came at a time where things on the business end of DROELOE were moving rapidly. We were
        really running a business at that point, and that was something that was completely foreign to us as two kids
        who met in art school and decided to start a project together without even thinking of what it could
        become.<br><br>I think something that I do often and that we do with DROELOE as a project is to kind of run with
        how we're feeling about things and what we think about certain things at the time - and take those feelings and
        ideas and pour them into our work. And I think this EP is a prime example of that.<br><br>Creating this EP was
        kind of a cathartic experience for me, and I'd like to think that I hold this EP and the timeframe around it so
        dearly, because it stands as a testament to us finding a way to deal with the hardships and uncertainties and
        turn it into something of meaning.<br><br><br></p>
