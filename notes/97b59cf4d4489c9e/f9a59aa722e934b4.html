    <p><br><br>The idea to build these EP's into an anthology collection began to form after the release of the second EP <i>The Choices We Face</i>.<br>But around that time none of us really knew the shape it would end up having and what story it would tell. The implementation of the story began to take shape in the late finishing stage of the third EP <i>A Promise Is Made</i>.<br><br>The three EP's are, together as well as separately, in multiple ways coming of age stories which are applicable to many scenarios even though they were inspired by my own life experience and often served as affirmations and explorations of parts of myself, and can therefore also be read and interpreted in multiple ways.<br>It made sense that these different perspectives would end up being a driving force in the conceptualization of the anthology.<br><br>When Hein and I realized together that all the facets of the music and the concepts behind them, as well as the visual interpretation of the EP's fitted beautifully in the same overarching concept of perspective and the multiple interpretations thereof, it just clicked to an almost mysterious extent that it felt like it was intended from the very beginning, although it definitely wasn't.<br><br><br></p>

    <p>The idea of doing an anthology album to sum up these last three is something that we landed on while finishing up <i>The Choices We Face</i>. We decided to do one more standalone EP, partially due to the fact that we like the number 4 but also because it felt like it needed one more chapter, one more perspective on this somewhat coming of age story that we've been writing over these last 5 years.<br>But that's when the idea popped into our head to eventually bundle them all together and present it as this larger than life project that had been in the making for 5 years.<br><br><i>A Matter Of Perspective</i> kind of serves as a summary but also as somewhat of an epilogue to that story. We took a good look at what the stories of the 3 previous EP's stood for, and tried to add a new perspective to them with the 4 new original singles on the album. We did the same with taking some of the old songs and turning them into reimagined versions of themselves.<br><br>For me personally <i>A Matter Of Perspective</i> stands for the idea that altho your story or a story is written in one specific way, your perspective on it and effectively how you look back on it is ever changing with the passing of time.<br>Looking back at certain things through the lens of time can often give interesting insights and potential new outcomes. And I think that is what we tried to achieve with this album.<br><br><br></p>
